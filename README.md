# Boardgame Lab's Virtual Table

#### Instructions

```
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

This repo isn't exactly setup for external contributions yet, so you
might want to ask on the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/AFPmxNa)
server if you run into issues running the code.

Also note that not all bits of Boardgame Lab are open-source, so this
code (while usable on its own) also interacts with proprietary
code in order to form the complete application.
